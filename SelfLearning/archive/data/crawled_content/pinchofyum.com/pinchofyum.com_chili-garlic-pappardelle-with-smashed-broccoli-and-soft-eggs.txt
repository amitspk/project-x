   This is a brand new recipe that’s part of our Spring 2023 SOS Series – in other words, EASY recipes!View our full collection of SOS recipes here.

[Paragraph 3] (20 words)

   Oh man, these slippery, spicy noodles are a TREAT. Silky, rich, full of deep flavor and a flash of heat!

[Paragraph 4] (26 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   I would say this recipe belongs less in the “normal family dinner” category and more in the “hangry / hardcore craving / last minute meal” category.

[Paragraph 5] (48 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   The big flavors end up being a bit much for my kids, so I make this for a need-it-right-now hungry mom moment that calls for something ultra-satisfying, silky, and spicy. I often end up eating it right over the stove in a moment of pure and absolute joy.

[Paragraph 6] (51 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   And luckily, the components can work for everybody (buttered noodles is always a kid win, plus eggs and broccoli!), so it can be easily worked into something family-friendly or meal-prep friendly if you batch some extra broccoli and eggs to throw into other meals throughout the week. SOS at its finest.

[Paragraph 7] (62 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   The miso just does something magical to this whole thing – if you don’t have it I think you’ll still end up just fine. But if you have it (hopefully I already convinced you to buy some with the Miso Crunch Salad!) it will elevate the flavor and add a depth that’s just really amazing for such a fast and easy recipe.

   The wide shape of pappardelle is just so fun. I keep myself stocked up with DeLallo egg pastas, including but not limited to pappardelle, tagliatelle, etc. We LOVE DeLallo and have worked with them for years – our longest running sponsor, and for very, very good reason. They have the best pasta essentials, both made with love and a high commitment to quality here in the US and imported from Italy.

[Paragraph 11] (22 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   Normally I use pappardelle for more standard recipes like theburst tomato pappardelle,slow cooker ragu,date night lemon pappardelle with shrimp, etc. (ALSO DELICIOUS.)

[Paragraph 12] (58 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   But in this case, the pappardelle reminds me of the wide, flat Asian noodles that are so delicious in recipes like pad see ew – and the DeLallo ones that I keep in my pantry are perfect for this spicy, noodle-y little number. It’s a fun Italian-Asian inspiration and combo that is – bottom line – very delicious.

[Paragraph 13] (12 words)

   Miso is a fermented soybean paste that is used in Japanese cooking.

[Paragraph 14] (13 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   I love white miso for sauces and dressings – remember theMiso Crunch Salad?

[Paragraph 15] (72 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   In this case, I think it builds really great flavorwithout requiring a bunch of time. The slightly sweet, barely fermented taste works into a silky, slippery, barely-there sauce for the noodles. When I’ve made it without the miso, it’s just missing that thing that makes me go back for seconds and thirds. The funk of the miso with the sweetness of the honey and the crunch from the chili crisp? Mm yes.

[Paragraph 16] (21 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   Just about any veggies would work here! Peppers, spinach, bok choy? Just roast or steam them and throw them on top.

[Paragraph 17] (22 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   And for an alternative protein, I think a nice piece of grilled, marinated chicken (Asian flavors, ideally) would be really good here.

[Paragraph 18] (35 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   One last thought: I personally love a big pile of twisted, tangled, uninterrupted noodles (no veggies), so that’s why I prefer layering over mixing the veg and protein right in. The noodles can stand alone!

[Paragraph 19] (31 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   Just leave out the chili crisp, or buy the less-spicy chili crisp! If you can find a chili onion crunch, that is delicious and I find it to be very mild.

[Paragraph 20] (45 words)
   [DOM: p, parent: div]
   I have two young kids, so for my girls, we pull out some noodles before they hit the sauce and make buttered noodles for them! And they love the roasted broccoli and eggs. Basically, all the same things, deconstructed, and minus the spicy. Everybody wins!
